               <h3>How it started</h3>
                <p>
                  My zero-waste journey began three years ago when  I was shocked by the amount of plastic waste I was generating each week. 
                  After watching a documentary about ocean pollution, I decided to make a change. I started small by replacing disposable items 
                  with reusable alternatives and gradually expanded my efforts to reduce waste in all aspects of my life.
                </p>
                <p> 
                  The turning point came when I challenged myself to go a month without creating any landfill waste. 
                  It was difficult at first, but it opened my eyes to how much unnecessary packaging and single-use items 
                  we accept as normal in our daily lives. That one-month challenge turned into a lifestyle that I'm passionate about sharing with others.

               <h3>My experiences</h3>
                <p>
                  My zero-waste journey has been filled with both challenges and rewards. One of my favorite experiences was 
                  starting a community garden in my neighborhood, where we use compost from kitchen scraps to grow organic vegetables. 
                  It's amazing to see how a small initiative can bring people together and create a positive impact on the environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I've also had the opportunity to speak at local schools about waste reduction, teaching children about 
                  composting, recycling, and the importance of making environmentally conscious choices. Seeing their enthusiasm 
                  and creativity in finding solutions to reduce waste has been incredibly inspiring.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Not everything has been easy, though. Finding plastic-free alternatives for certain products can be challenging, 
                 and sometimes more expensive. But I've learned that living zero-waste isn't about being perfect—it's about making 
                 better choices whenever possible and encouraging others to do the same.

              <p>
                Composting organic waste at home reduces landfill pressure and gives you nutrient-rich soil for gardening.
